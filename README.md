## What's `football.db`?

A free open public domain football (soccer) database & schema
for use in any (programming) language
(e.g. uses plain text datasets for match schedules, results and more).
More [`football.db` Project Site »](http://openfootball.github.io)


## Intro

Free open public domain football datasets include:

- [**Egypt**](egypt) - Premiership
- [**Morocco**](morocco) - Botola Pro 1
- and others



## Build Your Own `football.db` Copy

Try in your working folder (that is, `/africa`):

```
$ sportdb build
$ sportdb --verbose build     # or for more (verbose) details incl. debug info
```

This will

- setup a new single-file SQLite database e.g. `./sport.db`
- read in all datasets in plain text (`.txt`)

That's it.



## License

The football.db schema, data and scripts are dedicated to the public domain. Use it as you please with no restrictions whatsoever.
